A simple set of code I am working on to explore Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, NodeJS, JSDocs, ESLint and anything
else I find interesting.

Its all free, so use it if you want.

3. zbCulture class to help with different date formatting from different countries.
4. zbDayCalendar web component that displays month, day of month and day of week.
